# DOTA TEAM REPARTITION

At work, during lunch break, we love playing DOTA. Even though DOTA is a ~~friendly and lovely~~ game, we are faced with the same problem: **the team is not balanced**.

Why? Because each player has its own level. Some are still learning, some have played for more than 3 years but still struggling and some are, well, let's say "hearless".

So here I am, the superhero bringing them an application to balance the team based on each player's level.
